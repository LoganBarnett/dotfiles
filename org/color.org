#+title: Color

* theme
** brighter fringes
I like =doom-vibrant= I think, but I can barely see the line numbers when I'm
not in a dark room. We need to bump up their contrast a bit. Perhaps we could
even make them the same gray color as vanilla text, but use a separator line.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results none
(defun config/do-override-line-number-theme ()
  (interactive)
  (set-face-attribute 'line-number nil
                      :foreground "gray"
                      :background "black"
                      )
  )
(defun config/override-line-number-theme ()
  (on-doom
   (add-hook! 'doom-load-theme-hook #'config/do-override-line-number-theme)
   )
  )
#+end_src
** comments

At one point I wanted comments to be brighter, but it's mostly fine and I can
see extra colors applied to certain symbols within the comments. So best not to
touch them unless I have a comprehensive solution.

Old settings:

Comments shouldn't appear muted. I want to read them!

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results none
;; (set-face-attribute 'font-lock-comment-face nil
;;                     :foreground "#bb88ff"
;;                     )
#+end_src

* load
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results none
(config/override-line-number-theme)
(config/do-override-line-number-theme)
#+end_src
