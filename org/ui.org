  The UI section details configuration for Emacs' user interface.

  Since this is pretty core it should be called early in the startup sequence.
** deleting windowless frames
   When a frame loses its last window via =quit-window=, I want it to also kill
   the frame itself, rather than finding another window to display. This is
   really helpful for the hanging frames that I create.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp :results none

     ;; ADVISE ORIGINAL (built-in):
     ;;
     ;; If WINDOW is the only one in its frame, `delete-frame'.

     ;;   "If WINDOW is the only one in its frame, then `delete-frame' too."
     ;;   (message "window is %s and one-window-p t is %s" (selected-window) (one-window-p t))
