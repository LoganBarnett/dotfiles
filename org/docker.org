Docker is really the brand name. The more generic =Containerfile= is probably a
better choice than =Dockerfile=, and something we should support regardless.

I think =^= doesn't work here, because it uses the whole file path. So the
beginning of a path segment is really =/=. Really we should just copy what's
going on with =Dockerfile=, since we're happy with that.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results none
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist
             '("/Containerfile\\(?:\\.[^/\\]*\\)?\\'" . dockerfile-mode))
#+end_src
