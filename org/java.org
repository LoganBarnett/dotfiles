Java support in Emacs is surprisingly new, despite the age of both
tools/ecosystems.

* lsp
  The Language Server Protocol (LSP) can work with Java.

** eclipse language server

   At time of writing there's no Homebrew for this. Another script will download
   and unpack it in a location. We have to tell =lsp-java= where to find it.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun config/set-eclipse-language-server-dir ()
 (setq-default lsp-java-server-install-dir "/usr/local/opt/eclipse-language-server")
)
#+end_src

** organizing imports

By default organizing imports is done automatically. This creates a large churn
in the diffs for commits. Disabling it is the sensible thing to do.

#+name: config/java-organize-imports-on-save-disable
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq-default lsp-java-save-action-organize-imports nil)
#+end_src
** fix lsp-java

There seems to be a problem with lsp-java that Doom is using. For now work
around it with:

#+name: config/lsp-java-fix-missing-vars
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results none
(defvar lsp-java-errors-incomplete-classpath-severity nil
  "Some variable no longer declared upfront in lsp-java."
  )
(defvar lsp-java-dependency-package-representation nil
  "Some variable no longer declared upfront in lsp-java."
  )
(defvar lsp-java-configuration-check-project-settings-exclusions nil
  "Some variable no longer declared upfront in lsp-java."
  )
(defvar lsp-java-configuration-update-build-configuration nil
  "Some variable no longer declared upfront in lsp-java."
  )
(defun lsp-defcustom (&rest rest)
     (message "Someone called missing lsp-defcustom! This is an error but we're ignoring it.")
     )
#+end_src


* hooking it up

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb yes
  (require 'use-package)

  ;; (use-package "lsp-java"
  ;;   :init
    ;; <<config/lsp-java-fix-missing-vars>>
    <<config/java-organize-imports-on-save-disable>>
  ;; )
    ;; (add-hook 'java-mode-hook (lambda ()
    ;;   (require 'lsp-java)
    ;;   (add-hook 'java-mode-hook #'lsp-java-enable)
    ;;   (config/set-eclipse-language-server-dir)
    ;; ))
#+end_src
