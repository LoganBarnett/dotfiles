* ruby

The module provided in Doom isn't as flexible as I'd have liked. Instead of
trying to hack it until it works, this file will serve as my configuration. At
some point I could put together a pull request, but I need it working for me
first.

** multi-line

#+name: config/ruby-multi-line-strategy
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results none :tangle no
(setq-default multi-line-ruby-strategy multi-line-current-strategy)
#+end_src

#+name: config/ruby-multi-line-strategy-hook
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results none :tangle no :noweb yes
(defun config/multi-line-ruby-strategy ()
  <<config/ruby-multi-line-strategy>>
  )
(add-hook 'ruby-mode-hook #'config/multi-line-ruby-strategy)
#+end_src

** prettier

Instead of the standard =rubocop=, I prefer to let the machine do the hard work
of formatting. To that effect there is [[https://github.com/prettier/plugin-ruby][prettier for ruby]], which I am happy to
employ.

*** disable rubocop

Before we install =prettier=, we have to disable =rubocop= first. =rubocop= is
quite built into =ruby-mode=, but it does have a flag we can use to disable it.

#+name: config/ruby-rubocop-disable
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results none
(setq-default ruby-flymake-use-rubocop-if-available nil)
#+end_src

** stitch

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results none :noweb yes
(use-package "ruby-mode"
  :init
  <<config/ruby-rubocopy-disable>>
  <<config/ruby-multi-line-strategy-hook>>
  :config
 )
#+end_src
