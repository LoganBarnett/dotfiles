For a long time, editors have color coded keywords in the languages they
support. This is great when you're a beginner, but quickly the keywords just
blend into the landscape of the code. The colors help us read, yes, but only in
that they give us things to semi-ignore. With rainbow identifiers, all
identifiers (including keywords) become colored. Words are hashed and a color
chosen based on the hash. Any given word shares the same color with its
duplicates. This means you still get keyword highlighting but each keyword is
different. The =rainbow-identifiers= package helps us with this.

* vibrant colors
If the colors are too muted, I can't pick them out well and it just turns into
clown-barf on my screen without much gain. Let's make them more vibrant.
