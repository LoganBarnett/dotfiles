* derive from prog-mode

I haven't gotten this working yet. The original [[~/.doom-emacs.d/.local/straight/repos/applescript-mode/applescript-mode.el][applescript-mode.el]] file has a
=applescript-mode= function that will need to converted to =body= below, but I'm
not sure how much of it is necessary to convert. From looking at [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Derived-Modes.html][Derived-Modes]],
I'm left with the impression that at least some things are handled implicitly.
One example is the =<mode-name>-map= variable. I need to read up on this more.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results none
(define-derived-mode
  applescript-mode
  prog-mode "Applescript"
  "Major mode for Applescript."
  (body)
  )

#+end_src
