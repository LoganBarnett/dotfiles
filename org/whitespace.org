#+TAGS:   whitespace code

Managing whitespace settings is something a computer can and should do. Having
the human control this seems a bit absurd to me, but automatic code cleanup
tools can often be few and far between. Fortunately Emacs has some options for
cleaning up whitespace.

* cleaning up whitespace
  There's a few packages out there, but the one that interests me is [[https://github.com/lewang/ws-butler][ws-butler]].
  A notable thing about =ws-butler= is that it cleans whitespace on only the
  lines that have been edited. This means _my_ changes can be clean, but my pull
  requests won't be full of unrelated whitespace fixes. My general philosophy to
  editing code is that every line I change is a line I now own, so =ws-butler=
  fits nicely with that.

  I mostly want this for any kind of programming mode, but also =org-mode= seems
  like a place where I'd want it as well.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (use-package "ws-butler"
      ;; :ensure t
      :config
      (setq-default ws-butler-keep-whitespace-before-point nil)
      (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'ws-butler-mode)
      (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'ws-butler-mode)
      (message "ws-butler configured.")
      )
  #+END_SRC

* indicating 80 column overflow

  =fci-mode= draws a vertical line at the 80 column mark, but it seems to run
  into performance issues both just generally and compounded with =linum-mode=
  even after using a much faster version of =linum-mode=. =whitespace-mode=
  highlights text that flows over the limit, which has proven faster for [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/31145/14851][others]].

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :results none
(use-package "whitespace"
  ;; :ensure t
  :init
  (setq-default
   whitespace-line-column 80
   whitespace-style '(
     face
     ;; `indentation' doesn't seem to work here.
     ;;
     ;; indentation
     lines-tail
     newline
     newline-mark
     tab-mark
     tabs
     trailing
     )
   )
   (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'whitespace-mode)
   :config
   )
  #+end_src
