* Introduction

CSS has its quirks, but it's a very expressive means of building layout and
appearance of a UI. Complain as many people do, I've yet to see its better.

* css-mode


** indentation

*** offset

I don't know where people get a tab width of 4 from, but let's fix that pronto.

#+name: config/css-indentation-offset-fix
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
  (setq-default css-indent-offset 2)
#+end_src

*** spaces

Tabs lost.  Let's just use spaces please.

Keep in mind that =dtrt-indent= can override this value.  Use
=dtrt-indent-diagnosis= to see why it's getting set to one or the other.

#+name: config/css-indentation-use-spaces
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
  (setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results none :noweb yes
(use-package "css-mode"
  :init
  <<config/css-indentation-offset-fix>>
  :config
  <<config/css-indentation-use-spaces>>
  )
#+end_src
