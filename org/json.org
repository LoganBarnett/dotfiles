* show line numbers
  It's puzzling to me why we hate line numbers so much in our editors. Line
  numbers are life!

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :results none
    (defun config/json-mode-show-line-numbers ()
      (add-hook 'json-mode-hook 'display-line-numbers-mode)
    )
  #+end_src

* indentation
  I'm not sure why 4 spaces is considered good. It's not! How do you fit
  anything into the holy 80 columns with 4?

  Also we need to set the indentation when in =json-mode= directly, since it
  does not inherit from =prog-mode=.
  
  Perhaps because of Spacemacs, =js2-basic-offset= and =js-indent-level= are
  what =json-mode= looks at for formatting variables, according to this
  [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/issues/2333][spacemacs issue]]. We should set these variables locally as to not clash (if
  it's even possible) with =.dir-locals.el=.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :results none
    (defun config/json-indentation ()
      (interactive)
      (require 'json-reformat)
      (setq-default json-reformat:indent-width 2)
      ;; (setq-local js2-basic-offset 2)
      ;;
      ;; `js2-basic-offset' is an alias of `js-indent-level'. Setting
      ;; `js2-basic-offset' will cause errors with trying to make localized
      ;; variables an alias.
      (setq-local js-indent-level 2)
      (setq-local standard-indent 2)
      )
  #+end_src

* altogether

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :results none
    (require 'use-package)
    (use-package "json-mode"
      :defer t
      :config
      (config/json-mode-show-line-numbers)
      (config/json-indentation)
      (add-hook 'json-mode-hook #'config/json-indentation)
      )
  #+end_src
