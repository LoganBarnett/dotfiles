* editing text from a browser

Using [[https://github.com/alpha22jp/atomic-chrome][atomic-chrome]] we can edit text in a browser form/input using Emacs. This
way we get to keep our undo capabilities and our key bindings. Using Firefox we
can install the [[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ghosttext/][GhostText]] extension to communicate between the browser and
Emacs.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results none
(use-package atomic-chrome

  )
#+end_src

Unfortunately it doesn't seem to work right now. There is an error coming from
=char-or-string-p=.
