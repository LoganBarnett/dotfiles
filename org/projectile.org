Projectile gives Emacs project management capabilities. This includes searching,
selecting projects, and finding them.

* kill all buffers

Something has set =projectile-kill-buffers-filter= to =kill-only-files= which
means I typically have a bunch of =magit= buffers hanging around, or potentially
other things. I want those killed too, since I killed the project.

#+name: config/projectile-buffers-kill-all
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results none :tangle no
(setq-default projectile-kill-buffers-filter 'kill-all)
#+end_src

* projects directory

#+name: config/projectile-projects-directory
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results none :tangle yes
(setq-default projectile-project-search-path
              '(
                "~/dev"
                )
              )
#+end_src

* search for hidden files

I thought maybe this was too aggressive but it doesn't seem to be. A restart
seemed to solve my problem. Perhaps there was a delay?

* stitch

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results none :noweb yes
(use-package projectile
  :init
  <<config/projectile-projects-directory>>
  <<config/projectile-buffers-kill-all>>
  )
#+end_src
