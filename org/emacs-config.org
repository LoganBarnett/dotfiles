The menu bar on MacOs has lots of diagnostic information on my machine. This
information is clipped if the menu options from the focused application is too
long. The stock Emacs menu options are enough to force the menu bar items to be
clipped on a 13" screen. Switching off =menu-bar-mode= doesn't remove all menu
bar items, but it disables enough that this isn't a problem.

Flow is a strict type system that sits on top of Javascript as an
additional develop-time only annotation syntax.

There's a Flow spacemacs layer currently configured elsewhere. I'm slowly
migrating things in.

Flow is designed for incrementally adding typing. Also some things can be typed
as =any=, which basically means Flow will not type check that variable. As such,
it's possible for a lack of typing to leak into the code. Being able to
visualize type coverage is a really handy tool. It can be printed from the
command line like so:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE bash
./node_modules/.bin/flow coverage path/to/foo.js
#+END_EXAMPLE

But we live in the civilized world of Emacs, so we can just visualize this
inline for a given JS file.
