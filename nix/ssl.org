** Troubleshooting

*** New cert breaks everything

Make sure any new certificate files added for the trust have a line break at the
end, otherwise the begin/end header/footer will be joined to the same line and
=openssl= (Nix's) won't like that.  I haven't verified if macOS's =openssl=
isn't.  Make sure to add that line break at the end.

You may have to =sudo= edit =/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt= because the
main trust file is broken and Nix won't be able to download from sources such as
=github.com= anymore.

Look for a line like this, which should be able to be at the bottom:

#+begin_example
-----END CERTIFICATE----------BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
#+end_example

*** Magic command to verify if a host is trusted

This doesn't work yet, but this is the idea.

#+name: openssl-leaf-test
#+begin_src shell :results none :exports code
echo $host 1>&2
leaf=$(mktemp)
echo | \
  openssl s_client \
          -servername $host \
          -connect $host:443 \
          -showcerts \
  | openssl x509 -out $leaf
# There is a linebreak missing sometimes, so just add one.
echo $'\n' >> $leaf
namei -l $leaf
# chmod 777 $leaf
cat $leaf 1>&2
echo "^^^^ the cert should be above where the arrows point, not on this line."
echo $cafile 1>&2
echo "openssl verify -CAfile $cafile -untrusted $leaf" 1>&2
cat $leaf | openssl verify -CAfile $cafile
rm -f $leaf
#+end_src

#+call: openssl-leaf-test(host="doc-server.prod.hmheng-infra.br.internal", cafile="ach-em-ach-flintstones-ca.pem")

I still can't get this to work.
