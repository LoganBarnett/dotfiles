Python in Nix has some quirks to it, some documented and some not.

* optional dependencies

I've heard these called "extras" but I don't know if that's the official name
(more research needed).  Sometimes you'll see something in ~setup.py~ like this:

#+begin_src python :results none :exports code :tangle no

#+end_src
