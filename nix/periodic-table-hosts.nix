# I name all of my hosts on the network after elements in the periodic table.
# There's a lot, and it gives a somewhat memorable name to the hardware I use,
# without said hardware being always bound to a specific purpose (ex: gaming or
# LDAP).
#
# This gives me a lookup I can use for particular fun things about the elements.
# One such thing found in here is emoji that closely represent something about
# the element, which can be printed in the prompt for that host.
# I found a table with the emoji here:
# https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/cll1m1/emoji_table_of_elements_i_made/
# I need to add more.
