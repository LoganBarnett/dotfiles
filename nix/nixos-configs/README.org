These are "configurations" for NixOS.  They are technically modules too, but
specifically these encode selections already made.  They are not heavily
designed for parameterization or re-use, and they certainly have no place in
~nixpkgs~.  As such you'll see a lot of settings hard coded here.

My system did not start this way, so I will be slowly migrating over my
configurations to this directory.
