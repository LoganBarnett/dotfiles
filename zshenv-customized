# Force git to use ssh with IPv4. When tethered over my phone, everything is
# IPv6. While dig, nslookup, and ping all agree on the IP used by a source like
# github.com, this doesn't seem to be the case with ssh. Switching to IPv4 fixes
# this issue. It pains me that the fix for IPv6 related issues are generally
# "stop using IPv6", but I know of no other course to pursue here.

# One thread I can pull on is to attempt to use a recent version of ssh rather
# than the one bundled on macOS, which is probably tailing behind. While the ssh
# program has been a stable workhorse for as long as I can remember, it is not
# immune to bugs.
