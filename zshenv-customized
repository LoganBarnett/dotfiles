# Force git to use ssh with IPv4. When tethered over my phone, everything is
# IPv6. While dig, nslookup, and ping all agree on the IP used by a source like
# github.com, this doesn't seem to be the case with ssh. Switching to IPv4 fixes
# this issue. It pains me that the fix for IPv6 related issues are generally
# "stop using IPv6", but I know of no other course to pursue here.
#
# One thread I can pull on is to attempt to use a recent version of ssh rather
# than the one bundled on macOS, which is probably tailing behind. While the ssh
# program has been a stable workhorse for as long as I can remember, it is not
# immune to bugs.

# Nix has some weird stuff going on with curl and TLS certificates.  Nix won't
# assume the system certificate trust, so we have to make it do that for us.  I
# believe ca-bundle.crt is a file I have emitted somewhow but I need to check.
# In any case, this is required to get it working.  I do have NIX_SSL_CERT_FILE
# set elsewhere but that doesn't do the trick.
