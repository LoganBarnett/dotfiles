# sudo-ep
#
# Provides sudo via extended priviledge (EP) accounts.
#
# EP accounts are accounts on a host which are administrators/sudoers.
# The passwords for these accounts might rapidly rotate, making them infeasible
# to use for typical workflows requiring root access. Meanwhile, users needing
# such priviledges have an incredibly cumbersome mechanism to elevate their
# priviledges in order to perform basic local (and semi-frequent) administrative
# tasks.
#
# sudo-ep aims to be a sudo compatible program which can be aliased over sudo
# for real sudo purposes.
