# When connecting to the VPN, dnsmasq is started to achieve a split-DNS
# resolution. In some cases dnsmasq comes down but we don't reassign the DNS
# properly. This sets it back.
#
# I suspect this is not the complete answer to fixing a lodged DNS setting,
# since this just seems to lodge the DNS in a new way. Connecting to new
# networks will result in a successful DHCP query, and sets the interface's IP
# address correctly, but the DNS setting from DHCP does not work. It is likely
# that this fix should instead "unset" whatever has been set before by VPN.
