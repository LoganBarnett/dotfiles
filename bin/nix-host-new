# This is the executable checklist for creating a new host that is Nix managed.
# This can also apply to a fresh macOS system.  This differs from the
# nix-install scripts I have in that this is for any host and ensures all
# secrets needed are generated and in the correct location.

# At the moment, I don't have anything.  Add to this as I make new hosts.
# At the very least, the host SSH key (not to be confused with a user's SSH key)
# must be generated.  This is then copied to the right place via
# nix-host-key-install.
