  --image <image-file> Instead of building the image, use the one provided.
                       Ex: result/iso/*.iso or result/sd-image/*.img
  --disk  <dev-path>   Instead of auto detecting the disk, use the one provided.
                       Must be a fully qualified path.  Defaults to the
                       disk-detachable output.  Ex: /dev/disk4
  --noop               Do not perform any operations but output as if it did.
  --verify-boot <type> Verify the bootability of this image after it is copied.
                       Valid values for <type> are: efi.
