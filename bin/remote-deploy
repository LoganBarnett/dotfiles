# This script aims at faking some of the remote build stuff Nix claims to
# support.
#
# The problem:
# I can't figure out how to get Nix to deploy to another machine.  I've tried:
# 1. Writing the image to disk: QEMU segfault with a funky, trimmed down glibc
#    that I can't get rid of.
# 2. nixos-rebuild switch --target host - same problem:  It doesn't want to
#    build on the target host.  Probably because I don't have it setup as a
#    build machine.  Further investigation is needed there.
# 3. Praying to the machine god.  Offerings made according to specifications.
#    Prayers have gone unanswered, or a long journey of discovery awaits.
# 4. Using deploy-rs.  Same cross-build issues.
# 5. Using nixos-anywhere.  Same cross-build issues.
# 6. Using nixos-generate.  Same cross-build issues.
#
# The common theme seems to be cross compiling from aarch64 to x86_64, which is
# apparently not a direction many folks travel in.  Usually it goes in the other
# direction (x86_64 to aarch64).  There's some deep assumptions built into the
# build process as a result, I think.
#
# I've found that the manual is basically not be trusted.  Blog posts are far
# too outdated, or claims are made under a different arrangement of platforms.
# The message has been "read the code lol", to which I have done but I am just
# not deep enough into it with 4 weeks of massive personal time put into this.

Usage: $0 [opts] <hostname>

  --bootstrap <host>   Put this on a host first, then attempt to build it.
                       Normally remote-deploy assumes the remote to deploy to
                       and the build target are the same.  This allows for a
                       different deployment.  This can be helpful when Nix
                       cannot build on macOS because it still uses a case
                       insensitive file system (see
                       https://github.com/tstat/raspberry-pi-nix/issues/2 and
                       https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/2415 for open issues
                       on these as of 2024-06-03).

  --build              Indicate we should do a `nix build` instead of `nixos
                       rebuild switch`. Default: false.

  --enter-via <host>   SSH to this host instead of assuming the build machine
                       and target machine are the same.  This will also involve
                       a nixos-enter and mounting the disks found in
                       fileSystems.

  --no-switch          Do not `nixos-rebuild switch` - just copy the files.
                       This can be helpful for running this session over tmux.

  --efi                Write EFI boot entries when formatting with disko.

Copies nix files to a host via rsync over SSH, and attempts to do a
`nixos-rebuild switch`.
