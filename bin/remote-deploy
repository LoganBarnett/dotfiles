# This script aims at faking some of the remote build stuff Nix claims to
# support.
#
# The problem:
# I can't figure out how to get Nix to deploy to another machine.  I've tried:
# 1. Writing the image to disk: QEMU segfault with a funky, trimmed down glibc
#    that I can't get rid of.
# 2. nixos-rebuild switch --target host - same problem:  It doesn't want to
#    build on the target host.  Probably because I don't have it setup as a
#    build machine.  Further investigation is needed there.
# 3. Praying to the machine god.  Offerings made according to specifications.
#    Prayers have gone unanswered, or a long journey of discovery awaits.
# 4. Using deploy-rs.  Same cross-build issues.
# 5. Using nixos-anywhere.  It's nixos-nowhere as far as I can tell.  Same
#    cross-build issues.
# 6. Using nixos-generate.  Same cross-build issues.
#
# The common theme seems to be cross compiling from aarch64 to x86_64, which is
# apparently not a direction many folks travel in.  Usually it goes in the other
# direction (x86_64 to aarch64).  There's some deep assumptions built into the
# build process as a result, I think.
#
# I've found that the manual is basically not be trusted.  Blog posts are far
# too outdated, or claims are made under a different arrangement of platforms.
# The message has been "read the code lol", to which I have done but I am just
# not deep enough into it with 4 weeks of massive personal time put into this.

Usage: $0 [opts] <hostname>

  --no-switch Do not `nixos-rebuild switch` - just copy the files.  This can be
              helpful for running this session over tmux.

Copies nix files to a host via rsync over SSH, and attempts to do a
`nixos-rebuild switch`.

# rsync is ideal, but needs to be present on the remote machine.  We don't have
# that setup yet - or at least I have old installer without it.  Next time we
# look, switch.
# We exclude .git because we do a `git init && git add .` on the remote side,
# and this creates a .git directory.  This will prevent rsync from deleting the
# .git directory and then subsequently our script recreates it.  The process is
# very slow and we're going to update the staged state anyways.

# safely can traverse the wire, and wouldn't require rsync as badly.
