# macOS has a funny way of handling the hostname. You can indicate a
# ComputerName, which can be reset during an update to the operating system.
# Running this with the desired name should put it right. If your hostname seems
# to keep getting reset after reconnecting to a network or VPN, this could be
# why.
##

# This doesn't set anything permanently.
# sudo hostname $1
sudo scutil --set ComputerName $1
# I had set this too, but I think ComputerName is the real, persistent name. I
# think hostname (or HostName) is the name given by the network. I thought these
# were always one in the same, but macOS might have a different concept.
# sudo scutil --set HostName $1
# This one was also suggested, among the others above, here:

# sudo scutil --set LocalHostName $1
